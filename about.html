          <h1>About Polytechnic@UofM</h1>
          <p>
            Polytechnic@UofM is a new academic unit within the Herff College of
            Engineering at the University of Memphis. Launching in Fall 2026, it
            focuses on practice-oriented, technology-rich education that
            prepares students for high-demand careers in high-need industries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polytechnic@UofM offers condensed, workforce-aligned curricula
            (typically 30–40 credits) with alternative math options and flexible
            electives. Students can pair technical programs with other majors
            and earn credit through transfer coursework, industry
            certifications, and documented real-world experience.

          <h2>Polytechnic @ UofM</h2>

          <p>
            Launching in <strong>Fall 2026</strong> (pending THEC approval), the
            Polytechnic@UofM is a sub-unit within the Herff College of
            Engineering. It focuses on providing applied academic programs
            aligned with workforce needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The new sub-unit will be formed from applied technology programs in
            the Herff College of Engineering and the College of Professional and
            Liberal Studies, providing enhanced pathways from TCATs, community
            colleges, and returning learners to baccalaureate “applied
            technology” programs.
